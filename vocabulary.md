# Vocabulary for Bravo Cohort


### Git and GitHub Lecture
- directory - folder, place to keep files
- git - version control software
- GitHub - online platform that uses git
- version control - different iterations of the code
- repo - GitHub directory
- clone - local copy on your personal machine from a repo
- readme - inform others about what is in your repo
- markdown - text document that readmes are written in

### JavaScript Intro and Conditionals Lecture
- console.log - printing code in the terminal
- node - allows JS code to run in the terminal
- data types - the way JS takes in information: string, null, boolean, number, undefined, symbol
- modulo - remainder of a division problem
- conditionals - if/else statements
- variable declarations - telling you program you intent to create a variable, var, let, const
- equality operators - strict equals ===, less strict equals ==
- relational operators - < > <= >=
- logical operators - && || !
- built in methods - method built in to the JS program, built in functionality
- code blocks - executable code inside curly braces

### JavaScript Arrays Lecture
- index - location with in the array, arrays are zero-indexed
- value - the information stored at each index
- mutators - method that permanently changes the array it is called on
- accessors - method that doesn't change the original array
- push() - adds a value to the end of the array, requires an argument
- pop() - removes the last value, doesn't require an argument

### JavaScript Loops Lecture
- iterate - action that repeated until a condition is met
- for loop (three parts) - piece of the code that iterates, 1) start, 2) when it ends, 3) increment/decrement
- i (index) - location within the array, always start at zero

### JavaScript Functions Lecture
- argument - placeholder, value passed through the function
- return - output of the function, if there is no return it will log undefined
- call/invoke - code that runs the function - often console.log to see the output
- arrow/fat arrow - describes the function,
- pseudo code - plain English coding, describes the code for future developers
- string interpolation - way to add variables to string `${}`

### JavaScript Higher Order Functions
- higher-order function - function that takes another function as an argument, return a function as an output
- arguments accepted by map/filter - value, index, array

### JavaScript Testing with Jest
- yarn - a package manager, manages dependencies
- Jest - tesing framework for JavaScript
- TDD - test driven development, a philosophy of testing first and creating code that is dependent on the test
- red-green refactor - write the test first, watch the test fail, write the code, watch the test pass, refactor the code safely

### JavaScript Objects  
- object - container for named values and methods
- JSON - JavaScript Object Notation, collections of key: value pairs
- key - value identifier
- value - the value of a key, must be a data type
- methods - function that belongs to a class, functions inside an object
- dot notation - allows us to call the value from the object, chaining elements together
- this - references an object inside of the object scope
- destructuring - extracting data from an object by setting the key as a variable, limits long dot notation chaining

### JavaScript Classes
- class - blueprint for an object
- constructor - method in the class, creating and initializing an object within a class, called on to create a new object
- new - keyword for creating a new instance of a class, takes the class as an argument
- PascalCase - starts with an uppercase letter, similar to camel case, convention for naming classes

### JavaScript Inheritance
- inheritance - allows a relationship between objects, create parent/child relationships, allows data and behavior to be shared bewteen objects
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - software design that organizes content around data and objects rather than logic or functions
- extends - keyword connects a child to a parent that gives it access to the data and behavior
- super() - specific method required in the child class that calls the parent constructor method

### Intro to React
- component
- render()
- JSX
- public
- src
- App.js
- component call
